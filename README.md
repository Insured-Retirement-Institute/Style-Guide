# Digital First Specifications

This repository contains:

* Published OpenAPI specifications for the Digital-First standards
* Published AsyncAPI specifications for Digital-First messaging and event-driven APIs
* Style Guide and Versioning conventions used for all OpenAPI specifications

## Published OpenAPI Specifications

Once a working group's API specification has been reviewed and approved by the [Governance Committee](https://www.irionline.org/about-iri/committees/operations-technology/), the OpenAPI specification is moved into this repository and published at [specs.dfa.irionline.org](https://specs.dfa.irionline.org), which is the published GitHub Page of this repository.

## Style Guide

The style guide provides rules, regulations, and recommendations for Digital-First standards.

### Style Conventions

Field naming
- **Booleans**: Should be prefixed with is or has.
- **Lists/Arrays**: Use plural nouns to represent the array itself and singular nouns to represent the elements within the array.
- **Descriptions**: Descriptions for fields, parameters, and endpoints should be reviewed against existing specifications and reuse consistent terminology and phrasing rather than introducing new wording for concepts that are already defined elsewhere.

Custom headers
- **_correlationId_**: Optional custom header to be returned to the caller in response payload

Query String Parameters
- Sending **_Personally Identifiable Information (PII)_** as query string parameters such as names, addresses, email addresses, or account numbers, directly in URL query strings is a common practice to be avoided due to the significant privacy and security risks involved. 
- **_associatedFirmId_**: Optional query parameter for the associated firm ID

Regular Expressions
- There is no single universally adopted regex "standard," but Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) is the most widely supported and influential standard

Response Body Standards
  - Response body must only contain the resource or collection of resources that were requested (error responses are an exception to this rule.)
  - The response body should __BE__ the resource or array rather than an object that contains a named object or array that contains the data. Arbitrary renaming or nesting of single resources is disallowed.
  - **Metadata placement**
    - Transport and tracing metadata (e.g., `correlationId`) belongs in response headers.
    - Representation metadata that describes or navigates the payload belongs in a documented body envelope — not in ad-hoc wrapper objects.
  - **Exception — composite query results**: When a response delivers a collection together with metadata that describes or navigates *that collection* (e.g., pagination; see [Pagination](#pagination)), the body **may** use a standardized composite shape: a plural resource array plus a sibling `metadata` object. This is permitted only when:
    - The metadata fields are defined in this style guide (or an approved extension),
    - The metadata is intrinsically tied to the array in the same response, and
    - The shape uses the prescribed `metadata` sibling — not ad-hoc wrapper names.

        {
          "attr1": "val3",
          "attr2": "val4"
        },
    ...
      ]
    }
  </code>
</details>

### Pagination

Pagination introduces inherent complexity and accuracy tradeoffs — it can be difficult to guarantee a perfectly consistent dataset across pages when underlying data may change between requests. Because accurate pagination can significantly increase implementation costs and reduce adoption, and because IRI DFA prefers simplicity over complexity, **pagination should be avoided unless necessary** (e.g., when the full dataset is too large to transfer within typical server or API-gateway limits).

When pagination is required, working groups must choose one of the two supported patterns based on their business requirements.

#### Choosing a pattern

Offset-based paging and cursor/token-based paging are paging patterns available for working groups to adopt. Neither pattern guarantees a moment-in-time snapshot of the data; concurrent writes may add, remove, or reorder resources between page requests. The patterns differ in their implementation complexity, dataset accuracy and how callers should handle responses.

| Concern | Offset-based | Cursor/token-based |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Implementation effort/complexity | Med | Med/high depending on DB being used |
| Skipped or duplicated resources when data changes between requests | Expected; caller **must** deduplicate | Unlikely under stable sort order; iteration position is carried in the token |
| Dataset size | Suitable when fewer than ~10K resources | Suitable for large or unbounded datasets |
| Random access (e.g., "jump to page 5") | Supported via `offset` | Not supported |
| `totalCount` for "page X of Y" on a UI | Optional (discouraged unless required) | Optional (discouraged unless required) |

Use offset-based pagination when the business case accepts approximate completeness (with potentially incomplete or duplicated records) and the dataset stays small. Use cursor-based pagination when the caller must iterate the full result set reliably without missing/duplicated data (e.g., sync or export) or when the dataset may grow beyond ~10K resources.

> **Note on existing specifications**: Some published specs predate this guidance and use legacy field names (e.g., `start`, `startIndex`, `itemsCount`, `totalItemsCount`). New and revised specifications **must** follow the field names and response shape defined below.

#### Option 1 — Offset-based pagination

Query parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `offset` | No (default: `0`) | Zero-based index of the first resource to return. |
| `limit` | No | Maximum number of resources to return per page. The endpoint may return fewer resources than requested. |
| `orderBy` | No | Field name used to order resources in the result set. |
| `sortOrder` | No | Whether resources are ordered in ascending (`asc`) or descending (`desc`) order. |

Callers **must** be prepared to detect and handle duplicate resources across pages.

When the specified `offset` is greater than or equal to the total number of matching resources, the endpoint **must** return HTTP `200` with an empty resource array and omit `nextOffset` from `metadata`.

The API specification description for offset-based pagination endpoints **must** state the following:
- The data returned is **not** guaranteed to represent a moment-in-time snapshot of the data; concurrent writes may still affect results across pages.
- The caller **must** assume that, on occasion, some resources may be missing from the result set due to concurrent writes.
- The caller **must** be prepared to handle the same resource appearing on multiple pages (i.e., be able to de-duplicate resources in the result set). In this warning, also include the unique field (e.g., `id`) to be used for deduplication.
- When an endpoint supports sorting, the API specification **must** document the `orderBy` and `sortOrder` values that provide the most stability across pages — typically a unique, stable identifier.
- The endpoint may return a lower `limit` than the one requested by the caller.

#### Option 2 — Cursor/token-based pagination

Use cursor-based pagination when stable iteration through the result set is required, or when the dataset may be large or unbounded.

Query parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `paginationToken` | No | Opaque token returned by the server identifying the position in the result set. Omit on the first request. |
| `limit` | No | Maximum number of resources to return per page. The endpoint may return fewer resources than requested. |
| `orderBy` | No | Field name used to order resources in the result set. Must not change on subsequent requests in the same paginated session. |
| `sortOrder` | No | Whether resources are ordered in ascending (`asc`) or descending (`desc`) order. Must not change on subsequent requests in the same paginated session. |

Key technical implementation requirements:
- The `paginationToken` **must** be treated as opaque by callers. Implementors should encode the token (e.g., base64) to discourage interpretation.
- The token **must** encode sufficient state to resume iteration (including sort order when applicable). On subsequent requests, `orderBy` and `sortOrder` **must** match the values used to start the paginated session, or the endpoint **must** reject the request.
- `orderBy` options **should** include a unique, stable field (alone or as a tie-breaker) to ensure deterministic token generation.
- Implementors **must not** include sensitive information (e.g., SSN) in the token — the token is transmitted as a query parameter and may appear in server logs and browser history (see [Query String Parameters](#style-conventions) regarding PII in URLs).

The API specification description for token-based pagination endpoints **must** state the following:
- Pagination is **not** guaranteed to represent a moment-in-time snapshot; resources added or removed after the session starts may not appear in the result set.
- Pagination **does** provide stable forward iteration: callers should not receive skipped or duplicated resources under normal concurrent writes when using tokens as returned.
- When an endpoint supports sorting, the API specification **must** document the `orderBy` and `sortOrder` values that provide the most stability across pages — typically a unique, stable identifier.
- The endpoint may return a lower `limit` than the one requested by the caller.

#### Common response schema

Paginated responses are a composite query result (see Response Body Standards above): a plural resource array (named for the resource type, e.g., `policies`) and a sibling `metadata` object. Do not mix offset and cursor continuation fields in the same response — include only the fields applicable to the pattern in use.

| Field | Type | Applies to | Description |
|-------|------|------------|-------------|
| `offset` | integer | Offset-based only | Zero-based index of the first resource in this page. |
| `limit` | integer | Both | The page size used for this response (may be less than requested). |
| `nextOffset` | integer | Offset-based only | Offset to use to retrieve the next page. **Omit** when no further pages exist. |
| `nextPaginationToken` | string | Cursor-based only | Token to pass as `paginationToken` to retrieve the next page. **Omit** when no further pages exist. |
| `totalCount` | integer | Both (optional) | Total number of resources matching the query (before pagination). |

Note: Use of `totalCount` is discouraged unless the business case requires it, as it can be expensive to calculate.

**Offset-based example:**

```json
{
  "policies": [
    { "id": "001234" },
    { "id": "001235" }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 2,
    "nextOffset": 2,
    "totalCount": 100
  }
}
```

**Cursor-based example:**

```json
{
  "policies": [
    { "id": "001234" },
    { "id": "001235" }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "limit": 2,
    "nextPaginationToken": "eyJvZmZzZXQiOjJ9"
  }
}
```

**Last page** (both patterns): omit `nextOffset` or `nextPaginationToken` from `metadata`. An empty resource array with no continuation field indicates the caller has reached the end of the result set.

### Standard Error Schema

- Every error response—regardless of transaction type—includes:
  - An HTTP status code in the **400–599** range
  - A structured and validated **error code**
  - A **timestamp** of when the error was generated
  - A developer‑focused **technical message** (`message`)
  - A safe, user‑friendly **userMessage**
  - A **correlationId** for cross‑system tracing
  - A **field‑level** or **rule‑level** error collections

- Key Fields
  | Field | Description |
  |-------|-------------|
  | **httpStatus** | Numeric HTTP status code (400–599) representing the type and severity of the failure. |
  | **code** | Structured identifier in the enforced format: `domain.category.subcategory`. Enables machine‑readable error handling. |
  | **correlationId** | Carries forward the inbound request’s correlation ID header to enable end‑to‑end traceability. |
  | **message** | End‑user‑friendly explanation, safe to show in portals or consumer‑facing apps. |
  | **validationErrors** | Array describing domain/business rule violations; each entry requires its own code and message. |

Data definitions  
- **_policyNumber_** is the term used to describe the unique identifier of the policy.
- **_producer_** is the preferred nomenclature when referring to licensed/appointed professional or firm selling products.
  - **_producerNumber_**: Carrier assigned unique identifier
  - **_npn_**: National Producer Number
  - **_crdNumber_**: Central Registration Depository number
- **_party_** is the term used to describe a party to the policy (that is not a producer) and may be an individual or another legal entity.
- Describing individuals and entities
  - **_firstName_**
  - **_middleName_**
  - **_lastName_**
  - **_taxId_**
  - **_name_** (for business/entity)

## Bulk Asynchronous Request Pattern

For requests that return data sets too large or too time-consuming to return in a single synchronous response, Digital-First specifications adopt a standardized bulk asynchronous request pattern. This pattern was reviewed and approved by the Governance Committee and applies to any working group's API that needs bulk or long-running data retrieval.

The pattern is industry-aligned with established async integration patterns (RFC 7240 `Prefer: respond-async`, AWS S3 presigned URLs, webhook-based data export flows).

### Pattern Overview

The pattern has four interactions between two parties — the **Requestor** (the caller) and the **Data Provider** (the responding system, optionally fronted by a hub or intermediary):

1. **Bulk Request (Requestor → Data Provider).** The Requestor submits a `POST` request describing what data is needed. The Data Provider validates the request and responds with `202 Accepted` and a body containing a unique `requestId` and a `statusUrl` for polling.
2. **Data-Ready Notification (Data Provider → Requestor, webhook).** When the data is prepared, the Data Provider calls the Requestor's pre-registered callback URL with a notification payload describing how to retrieve the result (file identifier, expiration, checksum, size, etc.).
3. **File Download (Requestor → Data Provider).** The Requestor retrieves the prepared data via `GET`, either from a hub-mediated endpoint using the file identifier from the notification, or from a presigned URL contained in the notification.
4. **Status Lookup (Requestor → Data Provider).** At any time after the original request, the Requestor may `GET` the `statusUrl` to check the current state of the request and — when complete — retrieve the same payload that was (or will be) delivered via webhook. This endpoint is the recovery mechanism for missed or undelivered notifications and is **required** of any bulk async implementation.

Complete normative detail — required endpoints, naming guidance, response codes, status semantics, notification payload schemas, webhook security requirements, error code taxonomy, timing expectations, and intermediary handling — is in **[bulk-async-pattern.md](bulk-async-pattern.md)**.

## Versioning

All Digital-First specifications follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) to convey the meaning of changes in a release. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible changes (for example, breaking changes, addition of a required field, or deprecation of an existing field)
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner (for example, addition of optional fields or possible values)
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
- Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format (for example, `-rc.1`, `-beta`)

Individual firms decide the versions they will support. Firms can support multiple versions if they choose.

### API Versioning
- API's will utilize the major version at the URL level, and the minor/patch versions should have a head for X-Api-Version.  For example, an API with a version of 1.2.1 would have the following:
  - URL: https://example-api.com/v1/products.
  - Header: X-Api-Version: 1.2.1

Individual firms decide the versions they will support. Firms can support multiple versions if they choose.

**Note: The standard will be effective going forward to include the full version in the header.  All existing API's will be updated before 12/31/2026.**

### Messaging Versioning

Messaging standards apply Semantic Versioning through two levels of versioning that serve distinct purposes:

- **Topic version** = MAJOR version (API version / contract boundary)
- **Payload version** = MINOR version (backward-compatible evolution within a topic)

This ensures safe evolution of event contracts, consumer protection from breaking changes, and scalable governance across domains.

**Messaging specs should include both the topic and payload versions in each definition**

#### Topic (Taxonomy) Versioning

**Standard format:**

```
<domain>.<entity>.<eventType>.v<version>
```

**Examples:**

```
policy.contract.created.v1
policy.contract.created.v2
```

**Purpose**

- Defines the contract boundary
- Controls routing and subscription behavior
- Separates breaking changes


#### Payload Versioning

**Standard format (within message metadata):**

```json
{
  "eventType": "policy.contract.created",
  "version": "1.2"
}
```

**Purpose**

- Tracks schema evolution within a stable contract
- Supports minor enhancements
- Maintains backward compatibility


#### Combined Example

**Topic:**

```
policy.contract.created.v1
```

**Message:**

```json
{
  "eventId": "12345",
  "eventTimestamp": "2026-06-09T10:15:00Z",
  "eventType": "policy.contract.created",
  "version": "1.2",
  "sourceSystem": "policy-admin",
  "correlationId": "abc-789",
  "payload": {
    "contractId": "C10001",
    "policyNumber": "P98765",
    "issueDate": "2026-06-01",
    "customerId": "U12345"
  }
}
```
 
## API definition format

API definitions will utilize [OpenAPI 3.1.X](https://swagger.io/specification/) specifications

## Tagging & Releases

Git tags and GitHub releases mark specific points in the project’s history as official, shareable versions.  
They provide a clear, immutable reference for users and automation tools to download or deploy a stable build.

Follow **Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)** as outlined above, e.g. `v1.2.3`  
- **MAJOR**: breaking changes  
- **MINOR**: new features  
- **PATCH**: bug fixes  
- Optional pre-release suffixes: `-rc.1`, `-beta`

### Tagging
Use **annotated tags** on the main (stable) branch:
```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3
```
Tags are immutable—never overwrite an existing tag.

### Creating Releases on GitHub
Each GitHub Release should correspond to a tag. Releases provide a user-facing summary of what changed, include release notes, and may include built artifacts.

When drafting a release:
1. Choose or create the appropriate tag.
2. Select the correct target branch (usually `main` or the stable branch).
3. Provide a meaningful title.
4. Write release notes summarizing new features, breaking changes, bug fixes, and any migration steps or compatibility concerns. Properly attribute contributing PRs or issues.
5. Indicate if the release is a pre-release if it is not yet stable.

Include assets if relevant—binaries, installable packages, archives, etc. (GitHub automatically provides `.zip` and `.tar.gz` of the source at that tag.)

## Workflow / Policies & Governance

**Pull-request merges to `main` require two approvers.** All changes destined for the stable branch must be merged via a pull request and receive at least two approvals before merging.

**Restrict tagging and releasing to authorized maintainers.** Only individuals with appropriate permissions (e.g., maintainers) may approve and create releases or tags. This ensures quality control and prevents accidental or unauthorized releases.

### Automated pull-request checks

Every pull request targeting `main` runs the **PR Checks** workflow, which reports two independent checks:

- **Validate OpenAPI specs** — validates every file in `docs/specs/` against the OpenAPI 3.1 schema. This is stricter than what the published spec viewer requires, so it catches structural defects that would otherwise render without complaint (for example, a required `description` left empty, or a key indented at the wrong level).
- **Build data dictionary** — regenerates the data dictionary and packages the site the same way the publish workflow does, so a specification that breaks publication is caught on the pull request instead of after the merge.

Run both locally before opening a pull request:

```bash
npm ci
npm run bundle:specs
npm run validate:specs
npm run build:dictionary
```

See [Validating Specifications](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#validating-specifications) for how to interpret validation errors.

## Implementation Considerations

### Versioning

- Individual firms decide the versions they will support.
- Firms can support multiple versions if they choose.

### Extending the specification

- The focus of the standard specification is to specify the data structures and how they are used in API requests and responses to ensure consistency across implementations. 
- When implementing the specification, parties are free to add custom fields, headers, and data to existing definitions at their own risk.
- It is strongly recommended that implementers avoid modifying the data structures. 
- It is recommend that custom headers be used to facilitate exchange of request meta-data that allows the receiver to process the request correctly or for tracking purposes. - Example: a service provider may require that distributors include sourceFirmId and targetFirmId and correlationId header fields to facilitate transmission of the data to downstream carriers that would not necessarily be required in direct API integration between distributor and carrier.

### Authentication

- Individual firms decide the authentication mechanism they will support. Parties are free to decide how their integrations will authenticate with one another.

## Change subsmissions and reporting issues and bugs

Security issues and bugs should be reported directly to Hannah Pikus at hpikus@irionline.org and Matthew Hendrickson at mhendrickson@irionline.org. Issues and bugs can be reported directly within the issues tab of a repository. Change requests should follow the standards governance workflow outlined on the [main page](https://github.com/Insured-Retirement-Institute).
